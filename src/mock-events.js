The idea is to have the first one, just as a small get-together event, where I would really love to meet as much of you as possible and to hear more about your microfrontend projects/ideas, but also would like to use the opportunity to talk about the next, real, full-scale meetup event.</p> <p>The location will attach later after I see how many people want to attend, and depending on the interest, it might be a restaurant or might find some other location where we can have more space, in case of bigger interest.</p> <p>Once again short agenda:<br/>- Getting to know each other<br/>- Sharing microfrontend projects/ideas<br/>- Planning next, full-scale, meetup event</p> <p>I\'m really excited and looking forward to meeting you all!!</p> ',
